#ToDo List

- [x] Manual sorting fixed (Drag and Drop in Playlist)
- [x] Time bar bug fixed (Increased refresh rate and robustness)
- [x] Drop on playlist fixed (Supports dragging files directly into the panel)
- [x] Advanced Playlist sorting (Name A-Z/Z-A, Duration ASC/DESC, Folder toggle)
- [x] M3U Playlist Save/Load (Added dedicated buttons to the playlist panel)
- [x] Add open URL feature and unify playlist "Add" actions (File, Folder, URL) into a single dropdown menu for a more elegant design.
- [x] Fix zoom in and zoom out resize window.
- [x] Fix drag and drop to playlist issue. It doesn't work to add file or folder.
- [x] Add mouse on playlist open feature.
- [x] Improve OSD : Current ones has narrow bakcground issue if text is long and we need to expand it for all logical actions.
- [x] Auto-Hide Cursor: Ensure the mouse cursor hides itself after 2-3 seconds of inactivity over the video area so it doesn't distract the viewer.
- [x] Single Instance Override: If the user double-clicks a new video file in Windows File Explorer, it should open in the already running instance of your app rather than spawning a second window. This keeps RAM usage low and the desktop clean.
- [x] Support for other languages. (Added i18n system with `tr()` function and Turkish translation as a sample)
- [x] Pin control bar and pin playlist option by a button on each selves. (Implemented via right-click context menu toggles for a cleaner UI)
- [x] Borderless Window / Frameless Mode: Removed standard Windows title bar. Added custom draggable top edge and hover-activated title bar with Close/Minimize buttons. (Optimized performance and styling)
- [x] Figure out how we can make it an installable application. (Added PyInstaller spec and Inno Setup script)
- [] Make it proper github repo, .gitignore, README.md, etc.
